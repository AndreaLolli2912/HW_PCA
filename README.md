# PCA Homework (HW PCA)

This repository hosts all the materials and code for the mandatory project on Principal Components Aanalysis, for the course *Computational Linear Algebra for Large Scale Problems* (A.Y. 2024/2025). It features Principal Component Analysis through scikit-learn module to reduce a 150-feature survey dataset to at most 5 components (preserving at least 33% variance) and k-Means clustering to identify the profiles described by the coefficients of the 5 PCs.

## Task Overview

1. **Dimensionality Reduction**  
   - Use PCA to reduce the dataset to at most 5 principal components while retaining at least 33% of the total variance.

2. **Clustering**  
   - Apply k-Means clustering on the PCA-transformed data to identify 3â€“10 distinct customer profiles.

3. **Analysis & Interpretation**  
   - Analyze the principal components and interpret the clusters in the context of the survey data.
